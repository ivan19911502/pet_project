# Project "Complier festival for Ubuntu 18.04"


## Description
> This project is created to compile the application using gcc.

"Festival" â€” refers to the text-to-speech (TTS) system integrated into the Festival Speech Synthesis System. Festival is a widely-used framework for speech synthesis developed by the University of Edinburgh. It allows users to convert written text into spoken audio and provides a platform for developing and customizing voices.


Requirements:
-------------------------

> Ubuntu 18.04 or lower
> G++/GCC 4.8.x or lower
> make GNU
> git - ![festival](https://github.com/festvox/festival) , ![speech_tools](https://github.com/festvox/speech_tools)

## Installation 

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

   sudo apt-get install gcc gcc-4.8 g++-4.8 make libncurses-dev git

2. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/festvox/festival
   git clone https://github.com/festvox/speech_tools
   
3. Update version gcc:

   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 50          # Update version for C with priority 50.
   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 50          # # Update version for CC with priority 50.

4. Go to folder speech_tools:

   cd speech_tools

5. Start configure:

   ./configure CXXFLAGS="-fPIC" CFLAGS="-fPIC"      # Checks for the availability of necessary libraries and tools (e.g., compilers).       ## Specifies that all C and C++ files should be compiled with the -fPIC flag.        ### Creates position-independent code needed to build dynamic libraries.

6. Making speech_tools:

   ~/speech_tools$ make    # Controls the execution of commands for compilation and assembly using a configuration file, usually called a Makefile.

   ![Succesful make](https://github.com/username/repository/blob/main/images/screenshot1.png)

7. Go to folder festival:

   cd festival

8. Making festival:

   ~/festival$ make

   ![Succesful make](https://github.com/username/repository/blob/main/images/screenshot1.png)

9. Copy binary files:

   sudo cp -r bin/* /usr/local/bin/
   sudo cp -r lib/* /usr/local/lib/
